# Judges Arch Config
 The configuration parts needed to replicate Judges Arch


 In order to use this configuration and it's parts and peices, let's note a few things

 1) this is meant to be used on a Vanilla Arch + KDE5+ System, that has been freshly installed on Bare Metal

 2) there is a higher chance at breaking your system when you do not think about what you are doing, because we are going to be adding repos and keys, make sure that they are availible in your area before doing this, or it might render your system unusable

 3) i am not responsible for anything that happens to your system because of the use of my scripts, some are broken, and noted as such.

 4) use Kate or Vim to read the scipts before running them, and Whoogle what you may not understand


 with those things in mind, have fun!
